# My Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

 Here, you'll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, where I battled against elves, snowmen, and CPU cycles to solve coding challenges faster than Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve.


## Highlights 🌟

1. **Daily Coding Challenges**: Solutions for each day of December, progressively increasing in difficulty.
2. **Python-Powered**: All solutions are written in Python, leveraging its simplicity and power for problem-solving.
3. **Well-Organized Structure**: Each solution is in its respective `day-xx_task` folder for easy navigation.
4. **Reusable Functions**: Wherever possible, solutions include modular and reusable code snippets.
5. **Readable and Commented Code**: Solutions are written with readability in mind, with inline comments explaining the logic.


## Running the Code 🏃

Want to join in on the festive fun? Follow these reindeer tracks:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:dmshirochenko/aoc_2024.git`
2. Run the solution with the magic word: `python day-xx_task.py`

## Happy Holidays! 🎉

Feel free to poke around, and may your holiday season be filled with joy, laughter, and zero code bugs!
